# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Neural Networks

This project uses a **code deep learning approach** to predict whether bank customers are likely to churn (leave the bank).  
The model leverages **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** to classify customers based on demographic and transactional features.

## 📊 Results
- Model Recall: **74.8%** (prioritized to capture churners effectively)  
- Achieved good balance between accuracy and recall using ANN layers and dropout regularization.  
- Key insight: High-income customers and those with fewer active products showed higher churn tendencies.
